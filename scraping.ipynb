    "So far, we have only considered cases where we have a data set available to investigate. While there are certainly a lot of data sets out there to explore, many interesting questions require us to develop new data sets from scratch. The internet presents some interesting possibilities: It is full of data. *Web scraping* is the means by which we collect that data into a single database (or more specifically, DataFrame) for analysis. It can also be a useful method to reverse-engineer databases from a single website using their web interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping lives in a legal [gray area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping#United_States). Most sites would not like you to scrape their data: This data is often a valuable asset of the firm. Irresponsible web scraping can also disrupt the website and cause other problems for the firm. We will discuss below how to know if a firm allows scraping and we will practice on a website that allows scraping. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many potential methods to conduct web scraping. A few:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Manually copy and paste data from a webpage into a file on your computer.\n",
    "2. Use software. For example, there's a Chrome extension to automate web scraping. While this approach is easy and non-technical, it's also clunky and very limited.\n",
    "3. Write the code yourself. This provides more flexibility. There are python libraries that facilitate this.\n",

    "Robots! The internet we interact with is only the tip of a huge iceberg&mdash;underneath lies tons of information we generally cannot access. Search engine crawlers such as Google only have access to this *surface web*. Websites disallow crawling (or crawling certain parts of the site) by stating it in their ``robots.txt`` file, which is read by crawlers (or spiders) that would like to read the site. If a site disallows crawling, search engines won't go there, and the sites won't be indexed. If you decide to extract data from the web, respecting the wishes of `robots.txt` is necessary to avoid legal ramifications and to be a good internet citizen.\n",
