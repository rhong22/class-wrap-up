    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. We will take advantage of Jupyter notebooks. A notebook combines input (code) with output (results). It also allows us to mix in text, which will let us provide lots of documentation about what our code is doing. The text is added in *markdown* which gives us even more options. We will discuss markdown a bit later. \n",
